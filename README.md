Mapping of Massachusetts startup ecosystem with D3.js force directed graph.

This is a test mapping project in D3.js of Massachusetts' startup ecosystem. Here each node represents a ecosystem theme (e.g. workspace, accelerator, etc.) or a business/company.

Each company is connected to the theme nodes it falls under. The color of the node depicts the major theme role the company plays.

Click on each node to see the nodes it is linked to.

Search some predefined hashtags in the search menu.

This is a example, i.e. not a final version or draft.
